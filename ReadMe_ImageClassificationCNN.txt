Problem Statement: Identifying cats and dogs is easy for humans. The goal is to use CNN to make the computers do the same.
Approach: Used the Sequential classifier to initialize CNN, then added the convolutional layer. Performed Max pooling and applied flattening. Created a full connection and built model using Image Data Generator to identify the images of cats and dogs.
